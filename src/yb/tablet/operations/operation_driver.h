// Base class for operation drivers.
//
// OperationDriver classes encapsulate the logic of coordinating the execution of
// an operation. The exact triggering of the methods differs based on whether the
// operation is being executed on a leader or replica, but the general flow is:
//
//  1 - Init() is called on a newly created driver object.
//      If the driver is instantiated from a REPLICA, then we know that
//      the operation is already "REPLICATING" (and thus we don't need to
//      trigger replication ourself later on).
//
//  2 - ExecuteAsync() is called. This submits the operation driver to the Preparer
//      and returns immediately.
//
//  3 - PrepareAndStartTask() calls Prepare() and Start() on the operation.
//
//      Once successfully prepared, if we have not yet replicated (i.e we are leader),
//      also triggers consensus->Replicate() and changes the replication state to
//      REPLICATING.
//
//      What happens in reality is more complicated, as Preparer tries to batch leader-side
//      operations before submitting them to consensus.

//      On the other hand, if we have already successfully replicated (e.g. we are the
//      follower and ConsensusCommitted() has already been called, then we can move
//      on to ApplyAsync().
//
//  4 - The Consensus implementation calls ConsensusCommitted()
//
//      This is triggered by consensus when the commit index moves past our own
//      OpId. On followers, this can happen before Prepare() finishes, and thus
//      we have to check whether we have already done step 3. On leaders, we
//      don't start the consensus round until after Prepare, so this check always
//      passes.
//
//      If Prepare() has already completed, then we trigger ApplyAsync().
//
//  5 - ApplyAsync() submits ApplyTask() to the apply_pool_.
//      ApplyTask() calls operation_->Apply().
//
//      When Apply() is called, changes are made to the in-memory data structures. These
//      changes are not visible to clients yet.
//
//      After the commit message has been enqueued in the Log, the driver executes Finalize()
//      which, in turn, makes operations make their changes visible to other operations.
//      After this step the driver replies to the client if needed and the operation
//      is completed.
//      In-mem data structures that contain the changes made by the operation can now
//      be made durable.
//
// [1] - see 'Implementation Techniques for Main Memory Database Systems', DeWitt et. al.
